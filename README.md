# caesar_cipher

This is the third project of the Ruby curriculum from The Odin Project. It's terminal based implementation of caesar cipher, an encyption technique in which each letter of the string is replaced by the specific right or left shift.

# Problem solving skills

1. Remove all the restrictions given in the problem and start from that restriction which is easy to implement and you know how to do it. Don't try to solve the entire problem in one go.

2. Start by implementing that one restriction you know how to implement. Then, add the rest of the restriction one by one, like a layer of onion, on top of that one

3. In this problem, there were three main restriction:

  a) Give each string character a right shift. If it's letter 'a' and we give it a right shift of 5, it will become 'e'

  b) Take care of the case in the string. In other words, the output should be case sensitive.

  c) Don't do anything with the punctuation in the string. Let it be as it actully is in the string.
